# ReactPrep
Prepare for learning React

Going over some Javascript fundamentals I think will be useful when I go to learn React. Right now I am rereading some books at work and doing an advance course at the house. I dont plan on starting the next 2 React courses I have until I have cover the prerequisite topics. I want to get this right the first time, and so far I have been patient.
